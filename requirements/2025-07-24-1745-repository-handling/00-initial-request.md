# Initial Request - Repository Handling in ArcoCloud

**Date**: 2025-07-24
**Request**: We want to implement the handling of repositories in ArcoCloud. It should be base on @proto/api/v1/repository.proto which is not yet incorporated.

## Context
- The repository.proto file exists and defines a comprehensive RepositoryService for managing BorgBase storage repositories
- The proto includes operations for: AddRepository, DeleteRepository, ListRepositories, GetRepository, ReplaceSSHKey
- The service manages BorgBase repositories with SSH key authentication, storage quotas, and geographic locations
- This needs to be integrated into the existing ArcoCloud architecture following established patterns

## Proto File Analysis
The repository.proto defines:
- RepositoryService with 5 RPC methods for complete repository lifecycle management
- Repository entity with BorgBase integration (ID, URL, storage usage, quotas, SSH keys)
- Support for EU/US geographical locations for data sovereignty
- Strong validation for repository names, passwords, and SSH keys
- Rate limiting and authentication requirements

## Current State
- Generated Connect code exists at `backend/api/v1/arcov1connect/repository.connect.go`
- Local repository handling exists but needs cloud integration
- Existing service patterns established with auth, plan, and subscription services
